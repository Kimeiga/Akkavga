# Akkavga
## Top-down 2D Shooter with Reflected Shots

*Ak* is old Turkish for *white*, and *kavga* is Turkish for *fight*. Akkavga is a minimalist geometric experience. To kill enemies, the player must bounce his shots off the surrounding geometry. There are a variety of enemies. The game is being made with the Unity game engine, and will be ported to PC, Mac, and Linux and Android, iPhone, and Windows Phone.

This project is simpler than most of my game ideas because I really want to finish it this summer and experience finishing and publishing a game. I have a history of making really large projects and losing steam fast, so this may help me out.
